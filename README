NAME
    App::authkeymgr - Interactively manage SSH authorized_keys files

SYNOPSIS
      ## Manage authorized_keys interactively
      $ authkeymgr --help
  
      ## Build authorized_keys out of self-managed dirs
      $ authkeys-rebuild --help

DESCRIPTION
    authkeymgr provides useful tools for managing `authorized_keys' files.

    With a long list of public keys, user management and revocation is
    significantly easier when dealing with discrete single pubkeys that live
    in a sensible directory structure.

    The authkeymgr shell makes it easy to add "users" (sets of public keys),
    add keys to users from external files, revoke/restore specific keys, and
    rebuild `authorized_keys' after changes are made. (See the perldoc for
    authkeymgr or use the *help* command from the authkeymgr shell.)

    For more flexibility, authkeys-rebuild can be used for building
    `authorized_keys' lists from self-managed directories.

    The original stand-alone authkeys-rebuild was the result of a bored
    Sunday and a discussion on #linode @ *irc.oftc.net* -- blame heckman.
